# TuneTerra :- Akali
tuneterra is a personal for-fun project that conceptualises a spotify application based on the league of legends universe. <br>
the project focuses on [akali jhomen tethi](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Akali) and portrays her as an independent artist on the platform. <br>
the idea stems from the [official k/da lore](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/kda/), and explores the idea of her breaking away from canon and pursuing her own solo career as well as collaborations with other in-universe characters. <br>
